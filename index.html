		<p>Lindsay is a designer. She has the ability to design anything under the sun; posters, business cards, branding, websites, etc. She mostly enjoys working on projects that have tangible end results, like direct mail pieces and packaging. She is also talented and brave enough to code websites. A lot of designers grumble and gripe at the task of typing code for websites, it’s not something she finds tedious, but surprisingly enjoyable on occasion. </p>

		<p>Lindsay wants to make the world a well-designed place. There is a lot of horrible design out there that either needs to be fixed, or killed with fire.  That is why she’s here, to exterminate all the crappy design of today. Lindsay has always had a creative spark to her since she was little, experimenting with fine art mediums like painting and sculpting. Once in high school she realized she had a flare for graphic design. She might have also liked the fact that this was mostly completed on the computer and didn’t have to worry about getting paint in her hair. This all lead up to where she is now; a third year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College.</p>
